/**
 * GitHub channel: the factory's main intake and delivery surface, as
 * "Mercury".
 *
 * @remarks
 * - Credentials are brokered by Vercel Connect through the shared handle in
 *   `agent/lib/github/credentials.ts`; tokens are resolved per call and never
 *   exposed to the model.
 * - The name the factory answers to is resolved at runtime from the GitHub
 *   App's own slug (`agent/lib/github/bot-name.ts`), so the mention follows
 *   whatever the deployer named their app with no configuration, and a
 *   hardcoded handle can't collide with an unrelated GitHub user.
 * - `onComment` replaces the built-in mention gate to add an authorization
 *   check: it keeps the default mention and ignore rules, then dispatches
 *   only when the commenter's `author_association` marks them as trusted with
 *   the repo (owner, member, or collaborator). The dispatch stamps the
 *   `trusted` auth attribute, which is what lets the approval policies run
 *   reversible writes without a card. Mentions from anyone else are
 *   acknowledged without a session, so arbitrary accounts on a public repo
 *   cannot drive the agent's write tools.
 * - `onIssue` is the unattended intake: adding the factory label hands the
 *   issue to the pipeline. Only the `labeled` action dispatches, never a
 *   label carried on `opened`, because issue templates let unauthenticated
 *   reporters attach labels at open time. The factory label is matched
 *   against the issue's current `labels` array rather than a single "added
 *   label" field, because eve exposes the issue object as `issue.raw`, not
 *   the raw webhook payload that carries the just-added label. Applying a
 *   label requires triage permission, so the trigger is maintainer-initiated,
 *   but the turn itself runs unattended: the auth is rewritten to the
 *   constructed autonomous principal with the intake issue number stamped in,
 *   and the approval policies deny it everything except labels, progress
 *   comments on that one issue, and draft pull requests.
 * - `onPullRequest` dispatches only on the `opened` action and skips PRs
 *   opened by bots, which covers Dependabot and the factory's own
 *   `foreman[bot]` pull requests. It is deliberately not gated by
 *   `author_association`: reviewing outside contributors' PRs is the point,
 *   and the injected task is scoped to posting a single review comment.
 * - `onCheckSuite` is the red-CI fix loop, scoped to the factory's own work:
 *   it dispatches only when a suite completes with a failure conclusion on a
 *   pull request whose head branch carries the factory prefix, so a person's
 *   red PR never triggers an uninvited fix. The session runs unattended under
 *   the autonomous principal, anchored to the pull request, and the injected
 *   task bounds the loop by counting earlier fix-attempt comments on the
 *   thread. Requires the connector to subscribe to the `check_suite` webhook
 *   event.
 * - The `input.requested` handler posts a comment when a session parks on an
 *   approval or a question. The channel ships no built-in renderer for this
 *   event (as of eve 0.33), so without the handler a parked session waits
 *   silently, visible only in the run logs. The prompt spells out the reply
 *   incantation because `onComment` only forwards trusted mentions.
